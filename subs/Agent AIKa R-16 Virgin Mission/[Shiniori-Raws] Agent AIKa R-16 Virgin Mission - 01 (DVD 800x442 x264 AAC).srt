00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The depth is 150 meters.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's flowing to the left.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Ah!

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Feel the movement of the body with your body.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The enemy's display is slightly delayed.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes!

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's late. Look to the left.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Ah!

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Even a person like you can get a C-class license.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Salveja is also getting slimmer.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you're thinking too much, I'll do it again.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not thinking.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Find out the results of your own investigation.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Feel it with your body. With your body.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's mean.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The sun awakens.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's in my heart.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I aim for the blue sky.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If I close my eyes,

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can see the light of my memories.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If I close my eyes,

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can see the gap of my memories.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The nostalgic wind of that time blew.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Your smile is so painful.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Even if tears fall,

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll overcome the present even if I'm about to burst.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We were born in a time when we couldn't go back.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No matter what is waiting for us in the future passing by Ashimaya,

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll hold on tightly to my unwavering feelings.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I believe in that endless love and keep walking.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Thank you for watching.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Kikokoko...

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh no! The timer is off!

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Good morning!

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I couldn't make it to the homeroom again.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Sumeragi-san, you promised me that you'd punish me if I was late.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes, Ms. Risako.

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Then, after school, wipe the windows of the school building.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Of course, all of them.

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
All of them? No way!

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sumeragi-san, how many days do you think you'll be late today?

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, I think...

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Maybe five days?

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If you count the days of school, you'll be late for 30 days in a row.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, that's not bad.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not bad.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh, come on.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you're still in the homeroom, you're Ryo, aren't you?

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're right in front of me.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry again.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hey, don't fool around like that again.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You're being too serious.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Wipe the windows and reflect on yourself.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I guess I can't help it. I'm sleepy.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But Mel is growing up.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well...

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm just getting started.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll find your treasure.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm a professional, so leave it to me.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll accept your request fee according to your budget.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
First, I'll give you advice.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
One, two, A, Sumeragi, A, cut.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I wonder if he'll come soon.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The first request.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What?

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
C class is true.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Mel!

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You want to see everything with this?

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Everything?

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hey, what are you doing?

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I can't overlook it as a class member.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Class membership has nothing to do with it.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How much did you work hard yesterday?

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You can't just do business at school.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If you do this, the image of Class A will get worse.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll dismiss you as a class member.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Give it back.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I won't.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Give it back.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Give it back.

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Fine, I'll put it on again.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Then I'll take it off again.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll put it on so you can't take it off.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll put it on like this.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll put it on like this.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll put it on like this.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll put it on like this.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What?

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's enough.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Teacher, listen to me.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Class is starting.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Go back to class.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You look like you're having fun.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What are you doing here? Are you here to laugh?

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Come with me.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll tell you when I get there.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Treasure Hunting Club

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Treasure Hunting Club

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I didn't know there was a club like this.

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Did you make it?

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm the director.

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I didn't know there was a hobby like this.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A culture that has been eradicated from history.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Disappeared technology.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Art that I've never seen.

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Art.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
A sleeping treasure.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Isn't it romantic?

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So what do you want from me?

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That one.

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes, Miss Eri.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Miss!

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, you didn't know?

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is also a history.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
A history?

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What's with that look?

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
A history?

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I guess I should stop asking.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm counting on you.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
A small submarine of the deep sea industry.

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's not a beluga.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I like it a lot.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If it's a C-class Salvager, you can control it, right?

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Of course.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If it's a class like this, you can close your eyes and sleep.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The depth of sea at this time of year is good for the shape of the butt.

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you want to ride it?

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm asking if you want to control it.

134
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you going to let me control it?

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
All right.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's decided.

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's start.

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes, Miss Eri.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's start the adventure.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The departure is on the weekend.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Nice to meet you.

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
On the weekend?

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No way.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Seriously?

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Seriously.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm expensive.

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you going to make money in club activities?

148
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You want to ride the submarine, don't you?

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you looking for?

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Excuse me.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Please.

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
How is it?

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How?

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
As you can see.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
As you can see.

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's a club like that.

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Is it a club like that?

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What are you saying?

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's not.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Look carefully.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't have that kind of hobby.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We don't either.

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What?

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Are you saying stupid things?

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Here.

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Here.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's Joda.

168
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Joda

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a number.

170
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's interesting, isn't it?

171
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I found it.

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know until I tell Miss Eri.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't know.

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I didn't know until Miss Eri told me.

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I see.

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Then this butterfly wasn't drawn by you, was it?

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Maybe.

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Maybe?

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What does it mean?

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It doesn't mean anything in numbers.

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If you convert this number into a matrix and convert it into a row.

183
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It becomes a row of alphabets that doesn't make sense at all.

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But if you look closely, it's inside.

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The door to the truth will be opened by the sleeping butterfly.

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And this.

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The depth and the diameter.

188
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
As expected.

189
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Does that mean it's heading to this place?

190
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes.

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The answer must be here.

192
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The mystery that calls the mystery.

193
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm so excited.

194
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Hey, everyone.

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, boss.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm going to solve the mystery and tell the story of the butterfly.

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes, boss.

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What a strange club.

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Anyway, it's a great ship.

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Eri was really a great person.

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah.

202
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Then wouldn't it be nice if you paid for it?

203
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The amount of commission.

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm so rich.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
My father told me not to waste my money.

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Waste?

207
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Huh?

208
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There it is.

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You really like machines, don't you?

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm annoyed by your way of saying that.

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Miss.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Captain, what's wrong?

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Please come with me.

214
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Please come in, teacher.

215
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh, thank you, boy.

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What's your name?

217
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
G-G-G-G-Gust.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, that's a rare name.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
G-G-G-G-Gust-kun.

220
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No, that's...

221
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Just like that.

222
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's not going to work.

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Please do something.

224
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Mr. Risako is really...

225
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
By the way, why did you come with me?

226
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Because I'm a commoner of Trehanbun.

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Commoner?

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, it's a seal.

229
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Everyone should just die.

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The island.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It existed before the disaster.

232
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It sank.

233
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So you're going to investigate that sinking island.

234
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What kind of place was it?

235
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Was there some kind of facility?

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
There was an airport.

237
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Airport?

238
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Hey, I've told you many times.

239
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes, yes.

240
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I know.

241
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
If something happens, I'll take care of it right away.

242
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I have a duty to return you safely to your father.

243
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Excuse me, what do you mean?

244
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes.

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This area is a pretty ugly area.

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No matter what happens, it's not strange.

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Ugly?

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
There's a lot.

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's a kind of modern Bermuda Triangle.

250
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Manok area.

251
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's scary.

252
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's right.

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's the mystery we're looking for.

254
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So, when are you going to arrive?

255
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Tomorrow.

256
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Wait.

257
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Ah, me too.

258
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Isn't it too dangerous?

259
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The adventure is dangerous.

260
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's why the captain and the others are here.

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I think we should go back.

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're worried.

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I got scared by the captain's scary face.

264
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's not it.

265
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Ah, Zuboshi.

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Scary face.

267
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I told you that's not it.

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You two are close, aren't you?

269
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's late.

270
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Garen-san, would you like to come with me?

271
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you wish.

272
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Hey, are you there?

273
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Garen-senpai

274
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Eri.

275
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Where did you meet Garen-senpai?

276
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Where did we meet?

277
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
At the pool.

278
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What?

279
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Next door.

280
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Is that why you called me?

281
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I've been curious about it for a long time.

282
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I live alone in a luxury apartment.

283
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
When I go shopping, I buy luxury goods that even I hesitate to buy.

284
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Did you go to school?

285
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes.

286
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I asked my father about it on the Internet.

287
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
When I went to see Garen-senpai, I couldn't find his birth place or school history.

288
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's impossible, isn't it?

289
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What?

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You're the one who's impossible.

291
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Do you know what privacy is?

292
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I know what you want to say.

293
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But I want to know.

294
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's why you're always in the classroom.

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Classroom has nothing to do with it.

296
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm sure there's something, Garen-senpai.

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It smells like a mysterious thing.

298
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I can't wait for the first adventure tour of Trehanbun.

299
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm so excited.

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Hey, don't make me feel happy.

301
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You're honest and pure.

302
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Well, to be frank, you're a child.

303
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't want to be told by you.

304
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Garen-senpai

305
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes.

306
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Do you need anything, Eri?

307
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Eri!

308
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Let's go.

309
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is bad.

310
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Is this a surprise party?

311
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Of course not!

312
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What are you going to do to the chief?

313
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Aiko!

314
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What are you doing?

315
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What are you doing?

316
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What are you doing?

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What are you doing?

318
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What are you doing?

319
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What are you doing?

320
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What are you doing?

321
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What are you doing?

322
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What are you doing?

323
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What are you doing?

324
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What are you doing?

325
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What are you doing?

326
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What are you doing?

327
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What are you doing?

328
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What are you doing?

329
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What are you doing?

330
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What are you doing?

331
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What are you doing?

332
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What are you doing?

333
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What are you doing?

334
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What are you doing?

335
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What are you doing?

336
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What are you doing?

337
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What are you doing?

338
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What are you doing?

339
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What are you doing?

340
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Look!

341
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What is it?

342
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Something on his butt and neck...

343
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's like a machine.

344
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's gross. leben

345
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Someone must have controlled him with this.

346
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This is bad!

347
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Hey, are you okay?

348
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Hey, are you okay?

349
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Are you okay?

350
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Hey, are you okay?

351
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Hey, are you okay?

352
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Everyone!

353
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Everyone!

354
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What is it?

355
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What is it?

356
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What is it?

357
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What is it?

358
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What is it?

359
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Let go!

360
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Let go!

361
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I won't let you get away.

362
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Teacher, why?

363
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Too bad.

364
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
They failed, didn't they?

365
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Sumeragi-san, I'll teach you.

366
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Sumeragi-san, I'll teach you.

367
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
People can be suspicious.

368
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't like that!

369
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I see.

370
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Sumeragi-san, I'll teach you.

371
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I can't believe I was able to take him to the infirmary.

372
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I know where he went.

373
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Let's take him to the infirmary.

374
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Miss, let's take him back.

375
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Not bad.

376
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'll continue.

377
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Miss!

378
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Of course you'll continue!

379
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It was common sense to control a classmate who was brainwashed and attacked!

380
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,880
The purpose of that identity is to reveal the mystery of the mystery!

381
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,000
This is adventure! This is the real adventure!

382
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Captain, if you pull back here, I'll go to my father and have him behead me!

383
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Is that okay?

384
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Eri!

385
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's a nightmare.

386
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You go first and stop her.

387
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm sorry for the trouble.

388
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I was hired by Eri.

389
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But if she says she's going, then there's nothing we can do.

390
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
There's nothing we can do?

391
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What a troublesome kid.

392
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There's nothing we can do.

393
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's a mystery.

394
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
To be continued

395
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
To be continued

396
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
To be continued

397
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
To be continued
