1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,380
meet me at the

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
...

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Sensei, why!?

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Too bad. Those girls have failed.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
...

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Sumeragi-san, I'll tell you.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
People can be suspicious.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't like that!

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
...

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
...

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
...

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
...

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
...

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
...

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
...

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
...

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
...

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, but I don't know if it's the same thing.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's the same thing.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Actually, I'm grateful that I have a friend who protects her.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But at this rate, I'll look at the tree and attack again.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I understand. I'm counting on you.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Roger.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
When I close my eyes, I see the gap in my memory.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The nostalgic wind of that time blew.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Even if your bright smile is full of tears,

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Even if you're about to burst, you're going to go beyond the present.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We were born in a time when we couldn't go back.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Even if everything is waiting for the future to pass in the footpath,

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Just hold on tight to your unwavering feelings.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I believe in that endless love and walk.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I believe in that endless love and walk.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I believe in that endless love and walk.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I believe in that endless love and walk.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I believe in that endless love and walk.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Look.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I think they were controlling the people who were attached to Kei and Youzui.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I said that, though.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Judging from yesterday's situation, it's likely that Mr. Risako put this on.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's what I said, too.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't say anything unnecessary.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's because you say what I said as if you thought about it yourself.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's what I thought, too.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You're lying. You said it was disgusting.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're lying. You said it was disgusting.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's enough.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're lying.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's not a lie.

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a lie.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's true.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's not a lie.

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Karen.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This device will disappear naturally in a few days.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What?

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't have any symptoms, so I don't need to worry.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How do you know that?

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Senior, have you ever seen it before?

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Where did you see it?

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I think this device will disappear in a few days.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The way you say it has changed.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Then I'll go ahead.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who is that girl?

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Senior.

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No, that's not it.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Approaching the destination point.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's it.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We have arrived at the destination.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We have arrived at the destination.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Everyone.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We have arrived at the destination.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We have arrived at the destination.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Congratulations.

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Congratulations.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This club is strange.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And there are many difficulties.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's only the first time.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't say anything.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The real adventure begins now.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't let your guard down.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Be careful not to let your guard down.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Before we go on an adventure,

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I would like to have a beach party.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I would like to have a beach party.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Everyone.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Please drink a lot of water today.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Please drink a lot of water today.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I have brought all the ingredients.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Thank you for your hard work.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You stay with the girls.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I hope nothing strange happens to you.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes, sir.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Where is the captain?

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm investigating the seabed.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I see.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Wait.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Wait.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wow.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
150 yards.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
4 inch pin soba.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's delicious.

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But why golf?

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a little strange, Karen.

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He doesn't seem to have any old memories.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Loss of memory?

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's a problem if you don't have any memories.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Here it comes.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm hungry.

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm home.

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm home.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's delicious.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's delicious.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's amazing.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There is still a lot.

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Please eat a lot.

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It looks fun.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's good.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Everyone knows about the incident last night, right?

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Of course.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Why are you making me faint?

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No one cares about the children sleeping on the ship.

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Because it's an adventure.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No one cares about the incident.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Because it's an adventure.

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Adventure.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's natural to have one or two dangers.

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What are you talking about?

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, it's okay.

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Gusto, cook vegetables.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes.

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Roast meat.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes, I'm home.

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Season it.

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
With love.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What is that?

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Please cook this.

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes, I'm happy.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's a wild crab.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Where did you get that?

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Can you eat that?

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If it turns red, it's okay.

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If it turns blue, there is poison.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh.

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's a wild crab grill.

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you for the food.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Wild crab poison?

171
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This is bad.

172
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Everyone, cover me.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is...

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Ellie.

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Please take a look.

176
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Garen, Gusto.

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you okay?

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Fortunately, I'm fine.

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Gusto, take my bag.

180
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes.

181
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There is a sniper.

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Where is he?

183
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Teacher.

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I knew it.

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Gusto, dance and run.

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Are you stupid?

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If you do that, you will be shot.

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Are you going to sleep?

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You are crazy.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
There is.

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You have good skills, Sumeragi.

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Ms. Risako.

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I won't give it to Garen.

194
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
No.

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Please give it to me.

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's dirty.

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's a surprise party from me.

198
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Where is it?

199
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Garen, Gusto, help me.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Help?

201
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
How?

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't have a gun.

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Do something with wisdom and courage.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Please leave it to me.

205
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Anything is fine.

206
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Thank you.

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's okay.

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Four more.

209
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What?

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hey.

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hey.

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What are you doing?

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Garen.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Nice shot.

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Garen.

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What?

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It hurts.

218
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I missed the shot.

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Garen.

220
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Nice shot.

221
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I will stay.

222
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What?

223
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Where is the teacher?

224
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
By the way, that woman is not here.

225
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Me?

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
When did it happen?

227
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Garen.

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I can't deal with you.

229
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't need you.

230
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Move.

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes.

232
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hurry.

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Welcome, Garen.

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Sumeragi.

235
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Even if you are a Salveger,

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
you don't have to do anything.

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What are you talking about?

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's a mystery.

239
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's better to keep the secret.

240
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
There is a secret.

241
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's not enough to be happy.

242
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What?

243
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It doesn't make sense at all.

244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You are really stupid.

245
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes.

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was stupid and it was bad.

247
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Where am I?

248
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What?

249
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
By the way,

250
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
you only did the north side of the school.

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What?

252
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's enough to do only the north side.

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I told you to do everything.

254
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's impossible to do everything alone.

255
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's a punishment to do even if it's impossible.

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This punishment is too heavy.

257
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Hey, are you okay?

258
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Damn it.

259
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Are you okay, Sumeragi?

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's time to end this.

261
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Good night.

262
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Hey.

263
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Garen.

264
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What are you doing?

265
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What are you doing?

266
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm leaving.

267
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You don't have to tie me up.

268
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh,

269
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
who told you to suspect me?

270
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes, yes.

271
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I will listen to you.

272
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Then,

273
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
let's talk.

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Please forgive me.

275
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I have my own situation.

276
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I won't do that.

277
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You look scared.

278
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Answer me seriously.

279
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Who told you to do that?

280
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What's your purpose?

281
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't talk like that.

282
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Go home.

283
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What are you talking about?

284
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I've heard everything.

285
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The next agent will come soon.

286
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What?

287
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is the end of the adventure.

288
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What is it, Garen?

289
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's a blow.

290
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Senpai?

291
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's from yesterday.

292
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's too intense.

293
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll tell the captain.

294
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What's that?

295
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
A transmitter.

296
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You can hear it, right?

297
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's you, right?

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I remembered.

299
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
About the past.

300
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
About you too.

301
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But it's not all.

302
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I want to know about the time that disappeared.

303
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I want to know the real me.

304
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll decide the future myself.

305
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So,

306
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
don't bother me anymore.

307
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Please.

308
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm sorry, but please hang out with me a little longer.

309
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm sure there's an answer at the bottom of the sea.

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm sure.

311
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This again?

312
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Shut up and do it.

313
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Okay.

314
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Do it.

317
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay.

318
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Well,

319
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
if you ask me about the news so far,

320
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
even your father will stop you.

321
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's a waste, right?

322
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Of course.

323
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This is the real thing.

324
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I knew it.

325
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll leave the members because it's impossible.

326
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
See you later.

327
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Okay.

328
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The girls I caught were in the warehouse.

329
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You can do whatever you want.

330
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Well,

331
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
the submarine is ready.

332
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.

333
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
All right.

334
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Now,

335
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
let's go on an adventure of mystery and mystery.

336
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Let's go.

337
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's light.

338
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's it.

339
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Salveja,

340
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
get ready.

341
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Roger that.

342
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll leave the girls to you.

343
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Okay.

344
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Put the food here.

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What?

346
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's food.

347
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And

348
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Marumi.

349
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What?

350
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Look over there.

351
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes.

352
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If you look at me, I'll kill you.

353
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I didn't see that.

354
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Hey, are you okay?

355
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm fine.

356
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What are you looking at?

357
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's not mine.

358
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You're fine.

359
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The kids these days are...

360
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
No.

361
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It hit my hair.

362
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It doesn't matter.

363
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What are you talking about?

364
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If one hair gets stuck, it will sink.

365
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Don't yell at me.

366
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'll yell at you.

367
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's taking my life.

368
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's stuck.

369
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Submarine, start attack.

370
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Attack.

371
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Attack.

372
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Attack.

373
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Attack.

374
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Attack.

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Attack.

376
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Attack.

377
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Attack.

378
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Attack.

379
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Attack.

380
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Attack.

381
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Attack.

382
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Attack.

383
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Attack.

384
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Attack.

385
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Attack.

386
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Attack.

387
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Attack.

388
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Attack.

389
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Hello, everyone in Japan.

390
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm Eri Shinkai from Treasure Hunter.

391
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
We are now chasing the mystery and coming to the South Sea.

392
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What are you doing?

393
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
To learn about the past,

394
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
you have to hurt the people around you.

395
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And yourself.
