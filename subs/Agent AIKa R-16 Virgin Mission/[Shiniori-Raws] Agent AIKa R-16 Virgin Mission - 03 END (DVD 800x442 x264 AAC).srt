00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,960
100 meters depth.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,240
Battery check.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,560
Oxygen pressure check.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,160
No abnormalities in each part.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,840
Operation normal.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
How was the live broadcast, Erii?

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm tired of it.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And I'm sleeping.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,000
What?

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,000
It's okay, right, Karen-senpai?

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,000
You won't get fat if you eat that much.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,240
I wonder if she's eating all the nutrients in her body.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,440
Hey, what do you think, Aika?

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
It doesn't matter, so get on the seat properly.

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,120
Or you'll shake.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,400
Here she comes.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,600
What? What's going on?

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,600
I think she's stuck in the middle of the sea.

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,280
It's okay, right?

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,040
Leave it to me.

22
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,680
That's why you're worried!

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,520
Hey!

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,360
The sun shines on my heart

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,360
It's going to shine on the blue sky

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,360
If I close my eyes, I'll see the gap in my memory

27
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,360
The nostalgic wind of that time blew

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Even if your smile is so painful that it makes me cry

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Even if it looks like it's going to burst, I'm going to go beyond the present

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,600
We were born in a time when we couldn't go back

31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Even if tears are waiting for the future passing by

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,840
I'll hold on to the feelings I can't let go

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,840
I'll believe in that endless love and keep walking

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,600
The waves have calmed down, but...

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Karen-senpai is amazing.

36
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
There's light ahead!

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
What? What?

38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Look over there. There's red light and white light.

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
What's that?

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I don't know...

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
At this distance, it's a bit...

42
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
An airport?

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
That's right!

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
The captain said there was an airport!

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
And there's even a light!

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
It feels good, it feels good!

47
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Is someone there?

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I think so.

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Who?

50
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I don't know.

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Well, let's look into that.

52
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Let's look into that.

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Please follow the green light.

54
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
It's green! It's green!

55
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Look! Over there! Over there!

56
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Shut up! I know it!

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
It's like a secret base.

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
The smell of adventure is popping!

59
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
It's popping!

60
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Look! Speed up! Speed up!

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Full speed ahead!

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Shut up for a bit, you idiot.

63
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
It's a field.

64
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
There's a structure that looks like a cube in front of it.

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Inside, there's an opening that looks like a vertical hole.

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Go inside that.

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Roger.

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Now, we've entered a vertical hole!

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
It started again.

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
When it comes to vertical holes,

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
it reminds me of the Tateyama Shiki Jyukyo,

72
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
but I just remembered it,

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
so please don't mind.

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
The submarine will slowly, slowly dry up.

75
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
It started at level 1,

76
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
and now it's at level 6!

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
It's going to dive!

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
It's so noisy.

79
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Speed up.

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Just below.

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
20.

82
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
15.

83
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
That's close.

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Speed up.

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
3.

86
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
2.

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
1.

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Stop.

89
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
It's finally at level 9.

90
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Oh, look at that!

91
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
There's a shutter open.

92
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
It's a mystery!

93
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
We, Shinkai Eri and the Nakayoshi Adventure Team,

94
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
have no choice but to go inside!

95
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
What do you mean, Nakayoshi Adventure Team?

96
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
It's pitch black inside!

97
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Listen.

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
It's fine, right?

99
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
It's not you!

100
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Geez.

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Tateyama Shiki Jyukyo

102
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Here we are!

103
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Let's get off.

104
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Don't panic.

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
I'll analyze the air.

106
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
What are you doing?

107
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
It's in order!

108
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
You're late!

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Anyway, let's get out of here.

110
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
No!

111
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I said no!

112
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
We're stuck.

113
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
This is it.

114
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Wait!

115
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
It's open.

116
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
What's this?

117
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
It's an oki-tsuru.

118
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Here, Karen-senpai.

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Wait a minute.

120
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Wait a minute!

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
What?

122
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,600
You're so reckless that you're trying to push the button.

123
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I don't know what kind of place this is.

124
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
It's fine.

125
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
It's not fine!

126
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
What if something happens?

127
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
What are you going to do if something happens?

128
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
I know about this place.

129
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
You know about it?

130
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
You know about it?

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,600
This facility was also written on Karen-senpai's butterfly tattoo.

132
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I've never heard of that.

133
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
This is the first time we've talked about it.

134
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Tell me everything you know.

135
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Right now!

136
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
It hurts!

137
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
What are you going to do?

138
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Just tell me!

139
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
It hurts!

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
What's that sound?

141
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
No!

142
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Let's go back!

143
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
What are you doing here?

144
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
It's dangerous!

145
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Karen-senpai?

146
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm going!

147
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
I'm going!

148
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,600
A few decades ago, a life form was attached to a meteorite that fell to Earth.

149
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,600
That life form was able to make humans its host and continue to live.

150
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
I've seen a movie like that before.

151
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Humans, who became their host, slow down their physical growth, but their brain develops significantly faster.

152
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
No.

153
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Their brain develops.

154
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
I can see it now.

155
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
The door is slightly open.

156
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Someone is...

157
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Go! Aika!

158
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Why me?

159
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
It's because it's dangerous.

160
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Go! I'm not a dog!

161
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm not a dog!

162
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I knew it.

163
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Aika, do you remember the pattern on that door?

164
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
That's right.

165
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
It was attached to the women who attacked us on the beach.

166
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
That was like this too.

167
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
I can't ignore this relationship.

168
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,600
In that case, this is the last door, the door of truth!

169
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
That's it, Karen-senpai.

170
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Is that so?

171
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Why is it like that?

172
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Then, senpai, this way.

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Then, I'm going!

174
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Huh?

175
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
What is it?

176
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
That's strange.

177
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Karen-senpai should have the key.

178
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
As expected of Mystery.

179
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Mystery is your head!

180
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
You can't open it like this!

181
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
It's not that easy.

182
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Hey!

183
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
What are you going to do if something happens?

184
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I'm doing it to cause something.

185
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
This is it.

186
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Bingo!

187
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
This is it!

188
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
This is the keyhole that opens the door of truth!

189
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
A keyhole?

190
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Then, please.

191
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Huh?

192
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
A anesthetic?

193
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
I see.

194
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Roger.

195
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
What are you going to do with that?

196
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
I'm going, Karen-senpai.

197
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Erii...

198
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
What are you going to do?

199
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,600
The door of truth will be opened by the sleeping butterfly.

200
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I'll leave the rest to Yoshina.

201
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Erii...

202
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Help me.

203
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
What are you doing?

204
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm taking off my clothes.

205
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Huh? Why?

206
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,600
The scanner must be reading a date from the body, such as the surface of the body.

207
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
If that's the case, the clothes are in the way, right?

208
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Is that true?

209
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
I told you to leave the rest to Yoshina.

210
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Come on, hurry up.

211
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,600
You didn't have to take everything off, did you?

212
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I have to wear it perfectly.

213
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Anyway, it's a beautiful shape.

214
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
I'm really envious.

215
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Erii...

216
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
What?

217
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
No, it's nothing.

218
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Come on, let's put Karen-senpai in the scanner.

219
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
That's the kind of club it is.

220
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
It started moving.

221
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
What?

222
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
It opened.

223
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Hey, you!

224
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
What are you doing?

225
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
What are you doing?

226
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
It opened!

227
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Karen-senpai, it opened.

228
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Wow, it's huge!

229
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
It's huge!

230
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Wow, it's huge!

231
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Wow!

232
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
What is this?

233
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
What is this?

234
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,600
What is the relationship between this place and Karen-senpai?

235
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
You idiot!

236
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
You came here to know that, didn't you?

237
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Well...

238
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Don't call me an idiot!

239
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
What are you doing?

240
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I was wondering if there was something in it, so I'm looking for it.

241
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Isn't it better to look over there?

242
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
There are so many numbers.

243
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
It's research data.

244
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
I'm getting dizzy.

245
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Erii, you're a good-for-nothing, aren't you?

246
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Idiot!

247
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Why don't you take the copy home and show it to someone who knows?

248
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I'll take a closer look.

249
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
The meter is the same.

250
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Didn't you say that the space life form makes humans the host?

251
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Huh?

252
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Yes, I did.

253
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,600
There's no possibility that Karen-senpai is the host.

254
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Right?

255
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
I see.

256
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,600
If she's the host, then she's obviously developed.

257
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Aha.

258
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
So that's why she's known as Father A.

259
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
This is where she develops.

260
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Here.

261
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Oh, a photo!

262
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
It looks like they're comparing several cells.

263
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
They all look the same.

264
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
A clone!

265
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
A clone?

266
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
That's right! It's a clone cell!

267
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,600
They made a clone from the host's cell and studied it!

268
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
But why?

269
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
The host will grow slower.

270
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,600
In other words, it means that it will slow down aging.

271
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
That's true.

272
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,600
And the brain develops, so the brain gets better.

273
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,600
If you can use that cell and use it for humans...

274
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
The world will change.

275
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
History too.

276
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
But the research on dreams didn't work out.

277
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,600
This is modern alchemy.

278
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
No, that's not what I meant.

279
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,600
If we ask an expert on this, we might be able to find out more.

280
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
That's what I said earlier.

281
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
We have to get Karen out of the scanner.

282
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Good grief.

283
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
What's that weird voice?

284
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Karen-senpai?

285
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
No, it's not Karen-senpai!

286
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
And...

287
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Karen-senpai is growing!

288
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
No, it's a clone!

289
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
A clone...

290
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
I see.

291
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Oh, it's us!

292
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
They attacked us!

293
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
We want to eliminate the host.

294
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,600
We want to eliminate the host.

295
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Oh no!

296
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Eve, run!

297
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Hurry!

298
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Are you still going?

299
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

300
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
As expected of you, Icarus!

301
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
It's really small.

302
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Move, or you'll get hurt.

303
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Eri!

304
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Ow, ow, ow...

305
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
That's right. Eri is...

306
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Don't touch my friend!

307
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Aika...

308
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Eri, nice!

309
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I was careless because it was so small.

310
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,600
It's better to be careful.

311
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
I'm a little...

312
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
What?

313
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
What's wrong?

314
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
No, no!

315
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Eri!

316
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Eri!

317
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
What's that?

318
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Is that a clone too?

319
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
It's not a joke!

320
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Hurry, hurry!

321
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Eri!

322
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Thank you.

323
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Aika!

324
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Aika!

325
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Wake up!

326
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Wake up!

327
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Wake up!

328
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Kuroi-senpai is...

329
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Kuroi?

330
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Ow, ow, ow...

331
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Eri!

332
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Eri!

333
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Eri!

334
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Eri!

335
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Eri!

336
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Eri!

337
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
That's...

338
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Kuroi?

339
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
That's...

340
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
That's right.

341
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I was made here too.

342
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Yes.

343
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Let's go home.

344
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Those people...

345
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,600
They seem to fall asleep again.

346
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
I'm going to sleep.

347
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
It's disappearing.

348
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Good night.

349
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
That's right, Eri!

350
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,600
It's a shame that you couldn't get the treasure of adventure.

351
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Huh?

352
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
I got it.

353
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Huh?

354
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
What?

355
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
This is it!

356
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
This is it!

357
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Isn't it amazing?

358
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Two shots with the huge Kallen-senpai!

359
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
So this is what you were taking.

360
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
I took it.

361
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
This is a foot, right?

362
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Isn't it nice?

363
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
It's subtle.

364
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
What do you mean it's subtle?

365
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,600
That was close, Mr. Salvager.

366
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Thank you for the rescue, Captain!

367
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,600
If you die, I won't die for nothing.

368
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Captain, are you in the infirmary?

369
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Gast, you look like a young lady.

370
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Watch your words.

371
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Oh, I'm sorry!

372
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
My memories...

373
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,600
...were not real.

374
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Let's make it!

375
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Let's make a lot of memories from now on!

376
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Thank you.

377
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Did you enjoy your trip?

378
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Huh? What are you talking about?

379
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
It seems you enjoyed it.

380
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
I was able to see the results of what I did.

381
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,600
It's better if you can see the front.

382
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Huh?

383
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
You didn't enjoy it enough?

384
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Huh? That's strange.

385
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
I was looking at it properly.

386
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Well, there were a lot of things, but this first job was a great success!

387
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Kallen-senpai's smile was a great salvage!

388
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,600
There was a little mystery left, but I'll figure it out someday!

389
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
That's it!

390
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
This is a piece of cake!

391
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Yes, I'm late.

392
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Eri, it's you!

393
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Oh, Kallen-senpai.

394
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Good morning.

395
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Good morning, senpai.

396
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
But I'm late.

397
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
It's not just a little.

398
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Just a little is not enough.

399
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Oni!

400
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Say whatever you want, you're late!

401
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Dr. Risako!

402
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
There are two people who are late today!

403
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Both of you, come to the infirmary later.

404
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
I'll tell you what happened the other day.

405
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Go ahead.

406
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,600
No one will believe it.

407
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Kallen-senpai!

408
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Senpai, say something to that evil teacher!

409
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Good morning.

410
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Yes, good morning.

411
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
It's okay.

412
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
What's okay? You're late!

413
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
It's not like that!

414
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,600
I swear on tomorrow!

415
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,600
That's why the next episode is a physical examination.

416
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
That's it!
