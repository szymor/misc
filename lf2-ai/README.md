# AI script support for Little Fighter 2

### This repository contains:

* some AI scripts (by me) for custom-made characters:
    * YinYin's Aeron ([thread](https://www.lf-empire.de/forum/showthread.php?tid=115)),
    * YinYin and Siegvar's Frozen ([thread](https://www.lf-empire.de/forum/showthread.php?tid=6961)),
    * YinYin's Silva ([link](https://www.lf-empire.de/lfe-fileplanet/characters/394-silva)).
* archives with the characters,
* AI script ([AngelScript](http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/)) support library by Lord Silva ([thread](https://www.lf-empire.de/forum/thread-7927.html)).

### Quick instruction (by Azriel, modified by me):

1. Put the DLL in the LF2 folder (i.e. /lf2/ddraw.dll).
2. Make a folder named "ai" in the LF2 folder (i.e. /lf2/ai).
3. In the "ai" folder, any [id].as files ([id] being the ID of your character) will be used as an AI script for your character, so you'll have 13.as for a character with ID 13.
4. Start coding.
